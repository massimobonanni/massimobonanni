## 27/04/2021 - DeveloperWeek Europe 2021 - Online
### Abstract
A famous advertising claim says: "power is nothing without control". Azure is a powerful platform and it could get out of hand if we can't get control over it. For this reason, knowing how to organize resources, configure security and define the policies with which resources are created and managed is fundamental. In this session, we will explore the concepts needed to manage our infrastructure in the cloud and look at the tools you can leverage to accomplish that.
