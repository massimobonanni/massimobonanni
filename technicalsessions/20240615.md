# Automating Azure with Serverless Technologies
##  15/06/2024 - We Make Future 2024 - Bologna
### Abstract 
In a complex and articulated world like Azure's, it's crucial to be able to automate certain management operations. Rotating security keys, renewing expiring secrets, synchronizing services that don't have out-of-the-box synchronization modes are just some of the operations that we "must" implement in our solutions effectively and efficiently. Technologies like Azure Functions, Logic App, Event Grid come to our aid for this, providing us with a range of services that allow us to implement these tasks efficiently and cost-effectively. In this session, we will explore what events are in Azure and how they can be leveraged using Serverless technologies to achieve the desired outcome
