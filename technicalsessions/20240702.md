# Serverless Actor Model with Durable Functions!
##  02/07/2024 - Developer Week 2024 - Nuremberg
### Abstract 
The Actor Model is a mathematical model for the management of competition created by Carl Hewitt back in 1973 but become increasingly fashionable in modern applications especially oriented to microservices. There are many frameworks and platforms that implement it, but not everyone knows that the Durable Functions also implement a kind of actor model through their Durable Entities. In this session, we will see how the Actor Model comes against us in our complex solutions and how the Durable Entities implement it in a completely serverless way.
